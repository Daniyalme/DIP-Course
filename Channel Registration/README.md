## Overview  

This project reconstructs colored images from grayscale channels captured in three exposures (red, green, and blue). Inspired by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskiiâ€™s pioneering work, it leverages modern techniques to align and merge these channels into seamless RGB images. The result is a vibrant recreation of historical scenes, enabling a unique view of the past through computational imaging.

## Dataset  

The dataset contains:  
- **Input**: Grayscale images for red, green, and blue channels.  
- **Output**: Registered and aligned RGB images.  

These resources provide a foundation for automating channel alignment and color reconstruction.

## Methodology  

1. **Channel Identification**: Determine the corresponding RGB channel for each grayscale image.  
2. **Alignment**: Use statistical techniques to minimize misalignments and crop overlapping regions.  
3. **Reconstruction**: Merge aligned channels into a complete RGB image.

## Tools  

- **Python 3.x**  
- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  

Install dependencies:  

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```
