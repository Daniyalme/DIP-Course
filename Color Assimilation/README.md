## Overview

The **Color Assimilation Grid Illusion** is an ingenious technique that manipulates black and white images to create the perception of vibrant color. This project explores the fascinating interplay between visual perception and optical illusions.

By strategically overlaying colorful lines onto the original black-and-white picture, an illusion of color is generated. This mesmerizing effect captivates viewers, illustrating the complexities of human perception and the creative potential of optical illusions in art and design.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Showcase the powerful interplay between **grayscale images** and **color overlays**.
- Highlight how **optical illusions** can manipulate perception to "unlock" color where none exists.
- Demonstrate the creative potential of such techniques in visual media, art, and design.

## Key Components

1. **Color Assimilation Technique**  
   - Overlaying carefully designed colorful lines onto grayscale images to create the perception of full color.

2. **Visual Perception Studies**  
   - Investigating how the human brain processes color and how illusions can deceive visual interpretation.

3. **Applications in Art and Design**  
   - Using this illusion to create captivating artworks, advertisements, and visual storytelling tools.
